 * opens nothing — the card ends up mouse-only. That is not survivable here,
 * because the card is the ONLY thing telling two teachers apart when their
 * short names collide (both rendering as "Swapna A." is accepted, on the
 * grounds that the full name is one interaction away).
 *
 * A Popover trigger is a real button: click, tap, Enter and Space all open it,
 * Escape closes it, focus lands in the card and returns to the name afterwards,
 * and the primitive carries aria-haspopup="dialog" and aria-expanded for a
 * screen reader. Hovering is then added back on top of it, for pointers that
 * can hover, so nothing about the mouse behaviour changes.
